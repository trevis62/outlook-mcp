"""Shared helpers for Graph ``$delta`` queries.

These tools deliberately bypass the msgraph SDK and hit Graph's delta
endpoints with raw httpx. The SDK's typed delta builders rebuild URL
templates from query-parameter dataclasses (so a deltaLink passed through
them gets its ``$deltatoken`` stripped) and discard the ``@removed``
annotation on returned items, which delta-query callers need to detect
tombstones. Raw httpx is also easier to wire to the per-endpoint quirks
documented inline:

- ``/me/calendarView/delta`` requires ``startDateTime`` + ``endDateTime``
  on the first call but rejects ``$top``; you must pass
  ``Prefer: odata.maxpagesize=N`` instead.
- ``/me/contacts/delta`` accepts no query string at all on the first call;
  ``Prefer: odata.maxpagesize=N`` is again how you size the page.
- ``/me/mailFolders/{id}/messages/delta`` accepts ``$top``.

Tokens are *not* persisted by outlook-mcp — that's the caller's job (an
agent decides where it wants to store its watermark). We pass the raw
``@odata.deltaLink`` / ``@odata.nextLink`` URL through as the opaque
cursor string.

    Behavior:

    - When ``delta_token`` is provided it's used as the request URL
      verbatim — it's already a full Graph URL (either a deltaLink that
      starts a new sync round or a nextLink that resumes an in-progress
      one). ``initial_url`` is ignored in that case.
    - When ``delta_token`` is ``None`` we hit ``initial_url`` (the
      caller-built first-sync URL with whatever query params and
      Prefer headers the resource accepts).
    - We auto-follow ``@odata.nextLink`` inside a single tool call up to
      ``page_size * PAGE_SIZE_CAP_MULTIPLIER`` items so an agent isn't
      forced to chain four follow-up calls just to drain Graph's
      pagination on a large initial snapshot.
    - We stop early on the cap and surface ``has_more=True`` plus the
      nextLink as the returned token so the caller can resume.
    - We stop on a ``deltaLink`` and surface ``has_more=False`` plus the
      deltaLink as the returned token — the caller stores that and uses
      it for the *next* sync round.
    - If Graph returns neither (rare but valid: zero changes plus no
      deltaLink, which means the previous token is still valid), we
      return ``has_more=False`` and ``delta_token=None`` so the caller
      keeps using their old token.

    Returns ``(raw_items, next_token, has_more)``. ``raw_items`` is the
    accumulated list of dicts straight from Graph; the per-resource
    wrapper is responsible for mapping them through ``format_delta_item``
    with the right per-item formatter.
