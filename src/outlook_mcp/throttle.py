"""Retry-After honoring for the raw-httpx Microsoft Graph paths.

The Graph SDK path retries 429/503 via kiota's ``RetryHandler``. The delta and
``$batch`` tools deliberately bypass the SDK and hit Graph with raw httpx
(``_delta.fetch_delta_pages``, ``mail_read.read_messages``), so they don't
inherit that behavior. These helpers restore it:

- ``send_with_retry`` — retry a throttled *request* (envelope 429/503).
- ``retry_throttled_subrequests`` — retry throttled *sub-requests* inside a
  ``$batch``. Graph returns HTTP 200 for the batch envelope even when
  individual sub-responses are 429/503, so a naive reader records those as
  permanent failures. This re-issues a smaller ``$batch`` of just the
  throttled sub-requests, honoring each sub-response's ``Retry-After``.

Graph also enforces a global 130,000-requests / 10-seconds app-wide ceiling on
top of per-mailbox limits, so direct callers must back off on their own.
