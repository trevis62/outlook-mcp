"""Tests for Graph client reuse across tool calls (connection pooling).

`_get_graph_client` should cache one `GraphClient` in the lifespan context and
reuse it while the credential is unchanged, rebuilding only when auth swaps the
credential (switch_account / re-auth). Building a GraphServiceClient — auth
provider, request adapter, TLS pool — per call is wasteful on recurring loops.
