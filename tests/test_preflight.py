"""Regression tests for scripts/preflight.py.

The preflight script's entire purpose is to catch the v1.7.0-class bug:
a tool ships against a Graph endpoint that's documented as supported
but actually returns 403 / 501 / "not supported" on the target account
type (personal Outlook.com). These tests lock in the classifier so a
future refactor can't silently weaken the release-gate.
