"""Pre-release smoke test against the live Microsoft Graph API.

Run before tagging a release. Hits every Graph endpoint family that
outlook-mcp tools depend on, using the locally-cached token, and flags
any endpoint that returns 403 or 501 — the "not supported for this
account type" signals that unit tests can't catch.

Read-only. No writes, no sends, no mailbox state changes.

Why this exists: v1.7.0 shipped four mailbox-settings tools backed by
/me/mailboxSettings/*, which Microsoft Graph does not support on
personal Microsoft accounts (the project's only target). Unit tests
passed because the SDK was mocked. A 30-second curl against the live
endpoint would have caught it. This script is that 30-second curl,
codified.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/preflight.py

Requires that `outlook-mcp auth` has been run successfully — the
script reuses the cached token. Exits 0 on success, non-zero on any
endpoint failure.

# Each row covers one Graph endpoint family. The path is the smallest
# request that exercises the surface — usually a $top=1 list — so the
# script runs fast and doesn't drag the user's full mailbox over the
# wire. The label maps to the outlook_mcp tool group(s) that depend
# on this endpoint, so a failure points at the broken tools directly.
#
# NOTE: ``/$batch`` is exercised by ``outlook_read_messages`` (v1.11.0)
# and ``outlook_batch_triage`` but isn't directly preflighted — it's a
# POST endpoint with a body, and the current preflight harness only
# issues GETs. The underlying ``me/messages`` GET is already covered
# below, and ``$batch`` is just transport, so the surface is exercised
# indirectly. Refactor to support POST rows if a $batch-specific
# regression ever needs catching at preflight time.
