## [Unreleased]

### Fixed — 403 ErrorAccessDenied on every mailbox endpoint (personal accounts)

Token acquisition used the `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default` scope. That works for Entra work accounts, but on the `/consumers` endpoint it yields a token Graph rejects with 403 `ErrorAccessDenied` on every mailbox endpoint — `/me` succeeds, `/me/messages` does not. Since personal Microsoft accounts are this project's primary target, the server was unusable on a correctly-configured app registration: preflight reported 11 of 13 endpoints failing.

Verified against a live outlook.com account, same account and moment: `.default` token → 403, explicitly-scoped token → 200. All 13 preflight endpoints now pass, including To Do, which previously returned 401.

Token acquisition now requests explicit fully-qualified delegated scopes. Every call site must use the *same* list, because MSAL keys cached access tokens by scope and a mismatch causes a cache miss that drops the server into an interactive device-code flow it cannot answer — so `GraphClient` carries its scope list and the raw-httpx paths (`_delta`, `mail_read`) reuse it instead of hardcoding their own. `scripts/preflight.py` was hardcoding `.default` too, and hung on exactly this cache miss until fixed.

`read_only` no longer narrows the requested scopes: the documented app registration grants only the ReadWrite variants, and scope matching is literal, so asking for `Mail.Read` against a `Mail.ReadWrite` consent hangs. It remains server-side enforcement via `check_permission`, as it always effectively was. New `graph_scopes` config overrides the scope list for anyone registering a narrower Azure app that wants token-level restriction.

**Migration:** existing installs must re-run `outlook-mcp auth` once — cached `.default` tokens do not satisfy the new scope request.

Security hardening pass. Treats every tool input as attacker-influenced, on the reasoning that an agent driving this server usually has message content written by third parties in its context.

### Fixed — Access-token exfiltration via delta cursors (breaking for hostile input only)

`delta_token` was used verbatim as a request URL with a Graph bearer token attached, and nothing checked the host. A cursor of `https://evil.example/x` handed that host credentials carrying `Mail.ReadWrite`, `Mail.Send`, `Calendars.ReadWrite` and `Contacts.ReadWrite`. Reachable from `outlook_list_inbox_delta`, `outlook_list_events_delta`, `outlook_list_contacts_delta` and `outlook_changes_since` — all annotated `readOnlyHint=True`, so clients that auto-approve reads would not have prompted. Delta URLs are now validated against `https://graph.microsoft.com` before a token is minted, and again on every `@odata.nextLink` before it is followed.

### Fixed — Arbitrary file write / read via the attachment tools (**breaking**)

`outlook_download_attachment` wrote attacker-controlled bytes to any caller-named path, guarded only by a `".." in save_path` substring test that absolute paths bypass entirely. `outlook_send_with_attachments` and `outlook_attach_to_draft` read any caller-named path and mailed it out.

Both are now confined to allowlisted directories, enforced on the symlink-resolved path:

- **`download_dir`** (new, default `~/.outlook-mcp/downloads`, created `0700`) — the only place downloads may land.
- **`attachment_source_dirs`** (new, default `[]`) — the only places attachments may be read from. **Empty means nothing may be attached.** This is deliberately the inverse of `allow_categories`, where empty means open.

**Migration:** if you attach files, add the directories you send from to `attachment_source_dirs`. If you download attachments to a fixed location, either set `download_dir` to it or switch to paths relative to the default.

### Fixed — `outlook-mcp logout` did not log out

`cmd_logout` printed instructions but never deleted `~/.outlook-mcp/auth_record.json`, the record that enables silent token refresh — so a user who ran it was still logged in on the next server start. It now clears the record, and distinguishes that from the OS-credential-store entry, which still has to be removed by hand.

### Changed — Plaintext token caching is now opt-in (**breaking on Linux without libsecret**)

`allow_unencrypted_storage=True` was passed unconditionally, so on Linux without libsecret the refresh token was silently written to a plaintext file. Now gated behind `allow_unencrypted_token_cache` (default `false`): if no keyring is reachable and the flag is unset, credential creation raises `UnencryptedCacheError` with instructions, instead of quietly downgrading. macOS and Windows are unaffected (Keychain/DPAPI are always encrypted).

### Fixed — Truncated attachments reported as sent

`_upload_large_file` never checked the response to each chunk `PUT`, so a rejected chunk left the loop pushing the remainder and returning normally — the recipient got a corrupt file while the tool reported success. Each chunk response is now checked.

### Security — Hardening with no known exploit

- Delta requests pin `follow_redirects=False` explicitly. This is already httpx's default, but a redirect is a URL that never passed host validation, so the intent is now local to the call and guarded by a test.
- CI workflow declares `permissions: contents: read` instead of inheriting the repository default.

### Fixed — Documentation overstated token protection

`SECURITY.md` claimed tokens are "never in plain files". On Linux without libsecret they are, in a `0600` file under `~/.IdentityService/`. Corrected to match the README, which already described the fallback accurately.

## [1.12.0] — 2026-07-18

Performance & efficiency pass for recurring agent loops (personal-account mail + calendar). No new tools, no breaking changes; the default tool surface is unchanged (62 tools). Validated against a measured tool-schema token count (~8,644 tokens/turn) and a mid-2026 ecosystem review.

### Added — Config-gated toolsets

`OUTLOOK_MCP_TOOLSETS` env var (e.g. `mail,calendar,digest,delta`) loads only the named tool groups plus the always-on `account`/auth tools, instead of all 62. Groups: `mail`, `drafts`, `attachments`, `calendar`, `contacts`, `todo`, `folders`, `digest`, `delta`, `admin`. A client that only needs mail + calendar drops the surface from 62 → ~30 tools (~52% fewer tool-schema tokens per turn). Unset = all tools (backward compatible). The grouping is a flexible selector rather than a fixed core/admin package split — the measurement showed the admin/override/batch group is only ~7% of tokens, so real savings come from dropping whole unused domains.

### Added — Tool annotations

Every tool now carries `readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` (`ToolAnnotations`): 26 read-only tools, 8 destructive (delete/remove), the rest additive writes. Clients can auto-approve reads and gate destructive ops (delete mail, decline event) without a hardcoded allowlist. Classification lives in `toolsets.py` as one reviewable table, drift-guarded by a test.

### Changed — Concurrent digest

`outlook_changes_since` fetches mail / events / contacts concurrently (`asyncio.gather`) instead of sequentially — ~2–3× lower latency on the most-used recurring tool. Each resource still resyncs independently on a stale token; the `_meta.resync` order is deterministic regardless of completion order.

### Changed — Graph client reuse

`_get_graph_client` caches one `GraphServiceClient` (auth provider, request adapter, TLS pool) in the lifespan context and reuses it while the credential is unchanged, instead of rebuilding it on every tool call. A `switch_account` / re-auth swaps the credential object, so an identity check rebuilds automatically.

### Fixed — Throttling on the raw-httpx paths

New `throttle.py` restores `Retry-After` honoring on the delta / `$batch` paths that bypass the SDK's kiota `RetryHandler`:
- `outlook_changes_since` / delta queries retry the delta GET on 429/503.
- `outlook_read_messages` — a `$batch` returns HTTP 200 even when a sub-request is throttled (429/503); the tool now re-issues just the throttled sub-requests honoring `Retry-After` (bounded by `max_retries`) instead of recording a 429 as a permanent failure.

## [1.11.1] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed — `outlook_download_attachment` corrupted binary attachments ([#25](https://github.com/mpalermiti/outlook-mcp/issues/25))

`outlook_download_attachment` raised `UnicodeDecodeError` on any attachment whose bytes aren't valid UTF-8 — in practice every non-text file (`.pdf`, `.docx`, images, etc.). The tool double-decoded `contentBytes`: the msgraph SDK (Kiota) already base64-decodes it into raw `bytes` during deserialization, but the tool then called `.decode("utf-8")` + `base64.b64decode()` on the already-decoded bytes. It now writes `attachment.content_bytes` verbatim.

Regression from [#9](https://github.com/mpalermiti/outlook-mcp/pull/9) (v1.6-era), which added decoding that is correct for the raw Graph REST/JSON API but wrong when going through the SDK. Diagnosed and verified by @AI-OWEN. Added a regression test that downloads a non-UTF-8 binary payload and asserts byte-for-byte fidelity; corrected the pre-existing download test whose mock fed base64-*encoded* bytes and thereby masked the bug.

No API, signature, or tool-count change. **Tool count: 62, 13 categories** (unchanged).

### Docs

- Added a **Troubleshooting** section to the README covering `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` on Linux ([#24](https://github.com/mpalermiti/outlook-mcp/issues/24)) — point Python at the system CA bundle via both `SSL_CERT_FILE` (httpx delta/`$batch` paths) and `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` (azure-identity auth).

## [1.11.0] — 2026-05-22

### Added — Bulk message read via `$batch` (1 tool)

One new MCP tool: `outlook_read_messages(message_ids, format="text", concise=False, include_deferred_send=False)`. Reads up to 20 messages by ID in a single Graph `$batch` round-trip instead of N sequential calls. Per-message shape in `messages[]` matches `outlook_read_message` byte-for-byte for the same `(format, concise, include_deferred_send)` combo — agents can collapse a "fetch N messages by ID" loop into one call without changing how they consume the result.

**Return shape.** `{messages, failures, requested, succeeded, failed}` where `messages` is the read_message-shaped dicts in input order (Graph response order is not trusted; the impl uses the input index as the sub-request id and rebuilds), `failures` is `{id, status, code, message}` for IDs that didn't return 2xx, and the three counts satisfy `requested == succeeded + failed`.

**Partial failures are not exceptions.** A 404 on one of 20 IDs surfaces in `failures[]`; the other 19 are returned in `messages[]`. Only input-validation errors (empty list, >20 IDs, malformed Graph ID) and transport-level failures (Graph 5xx on the whole batch) raise.

**Tool count: 61 → 62, 13 categories** (no new category — extends Mail Read).

## [1.10.0] — 2026-05-22

### Added — Composed "since last call" digest (1 tool)

One new MCP tool: `outlook_changes_since(delta_tokens=None, fallback_window_hours=24)`. Wraps the three v1.9.0 delta tools (mail, events, contacts) into a single structured payload. Designed for recurring agent loops — a morning brief or hourly inbox sweep that wants ONE call instead of orchestrating three deltas and reasoning over raw item shapes itself.

**Return shape (top-level):**
- `mail`: `{new_count, modified_count, removed_count, urgent_flagged[], by_sender{}}` — `urgent_flagged` is mail where `importance == "high"` OR `flag == "flagged"`; `by_sender` is the top 5 senders by message count in the digest window.
- `events`: `{new[], modified[], cancelled[]}` — cancelled bucket holds delta tombstones; modified bucket is currently reserved (Graph delta responses don't carry an affirmative change marker on live events, so changes surface as `new[]` today — see the tool docstring).
- `contacts`: `{new_count, modified_count, removed_count}`.
- `delta_tokens`: `{mail, events, contacts}` — caller-managed watermarks for the next call, same pattern as the v1.9.0 delta tools.
- `window`: `{from, to}` — when the digest's bootstrap window starts/ends.

**First-call behavior.** For each resource without a delta token, the digest bootstraps by calling the underlying delta tool with no token (which returns a full snapshot plus a fresh token). It then filters the snapshot to the last `fallback_window_hours` so the digest doesn't surface thousands of historical items on first run. For calendar specifically: passes `start = now - fallback_window_hours` and `end = now + 7 days` to capture recent + upcoming changes.

**Subsequent-call behavior.** With a stored `delta_tokens` dict the digest uses each token verbatim, drains pagination up to 5 internal pages (~1,000 items per resource per call), and classifies each item. Each resource is independent — a missing or stale token for one doesn't block the other two.

**`syncStateNotFound` recovery.** If a stored token is too old, Graph returns HTTP 410. The digest auto-drops that bad token, re-bootstraps just that resource as a "first call", and surfaces `_meta.resync: ["mail"]` (etc.) so the caller knows their watermark was discarded. Other resources are unaffected.

**No new Graph endpoints.** This release composes already-tested v1.9.0 endpoints; preflight remains at 13 endpoints.

### Tool count
- 1.9.1 → 1.10.0: **60 → 61 tools, 13 categories** (no new category).

## [1.9.1] — 2026-05-22

### Changed — Tool docstring audit (no behavior change)

Docstring audit. Every `@mcp.tool()` docstring has been rewritten to a consistent shape — one-line action, contrastive pointer for ambiguous pairs (e.g. `outlook_reply` vs `outlook_rsvp`, `outlook_send_message` vs `outlook_create_draft` + `outlook_send_draft`, `outlook_reclassify_message` vs `outlook_set_inbox_override`, snapshot vs delta tools, search vs list, move vs copy, delete vs move-to-deleteditems), concrete syntax example for params with non-obvious shape (KQL queries, ISO 8601 dates, delta-token round-trips, attachment paths, batch shape). Designed to reduce wrong-tool selection by AI agents. No behavior changes; signatures, params, defaults, return shapes are byte-identical to 1.9.0.

## [1.9.0] — 2026-05-21

### Added — Delta queries (3 tools)

Wraps Microsoft Graph's `$delta` endpoints. The use case: an agent's
recurring poll (morning brief, hourly inbox check) currently re-fetches
the last N messages on every run, even when nothing changed. With delta
queries the second-and-later call returns only what changed since the
last token — typically 0–3 items on a stable inbox. Real money on
per-token billing for recurring agent jobs.

- `outlook_list_inbox_delta(folder="inbox", page_size=50, delta_token=None)`
  — wraps `GET /me/mailFolders/{folder}/messages/delta`.
- `outlook_list_events_delta(start, end, page_size=50, delta_token=None)`
  — wraps `GET /me/calendarView/delta`. `start` and `end` (ISO 8601) are
  required on the first call; ignored on follow-ups (the cursor encodes
  the window).
- `outlook_list_contacts_delta(page_size=50, delta_token=None)` — wraps
  `GET /me/contacts/delta`.

**Cursor semantics.** The `delta_token` is opaque to the caller (it's
the deltaLink or nextLink URL Graph hands back, passed through as a
string). outlook-mcp does *not* persist tokens server-side — the agent
stores its own watermark and replays it. Matches the existing
pagination `cursor` pattern.

**Tombstones.** Deleted items come back as `{id, is_deleted: True}`
with no other fields. Agents should treat them as cache evictions.
Live items also carry `is_deleted: False` for symmetry.

**Cap behavior.** Each call auto-follows `@odata.nextLink` internally
up to `page_size * 4` items, then stops with `has_more: True` and the
nextLink as the returned `delta_token` so the caller can resume. This
keeps a single tool call bounded even on a large first-call snapshot
(e.g. ~12k contacts).

**Verified working on personal accounts via the preflight script** —
the three new delta endpoints are reachable from `/me/...` on
outlook.com mailboxes without additional consent scopes.

### Tool count
- 1.8.0 → 1.9.0: **57 → 60 tools, 13 categories** (no new category).

## [1.8.0] — 2026-05-21

### Added — Agent-friendly shape

- **Concise mode** — opt-in `concise=True` flag on the five high-volume read tools (`outlook_list_inbox`, `outlook_read_message`, `outlook_search_mail`, `outlook_list_events`, `outlook_list_thread`). When set, the server drops bulky fields (`preview`/`categories` for message summaries; full `body`/`body_html` for single-message reads, replaced with a 200-char single-line `body_preview`; `body`/`organizer`/`response_status`/`categories` plus the full `attendees` list for events, replaced with `is_organizer` and `attendees_count`; quoted prior-message text on thread previews, via a heuristic on `On ... wrote:` / `From: ...` / `----- Original Message -----` markers). Typical payload reduction ~10×, designed for triage scans before deciding to fetch full content.

- **Graph error wrapper** — every tool now passes its result through a thin decorator that converts msgraph's `ODataError` / `kiota_abstractions.APIError` into a structured `GraphAPIError(status_code, error_code, message, action)` with recovery hints for 401 ("run `outlook-mcp auth` on the host"), 403/`ErrorAccessDenied` (ROADMAP pointer to known unsupported-endpoint dead-ends), 404/`ErrorItemNotFound` ("re-list to get fresh IDs"), 429 ("back off, respect Retry-After"), and 503 ("transient — retry after a short delay"). `OutlookMCPError` subclasses and `ValueError`s pass through unchanged; non-Graph exceptions bubble up untouched.

No new tools; existing tool responses unchanged when `concise=False` (default). Strict backward compat for existing callers.

### Tool count
- 1.7.1 → 1.8.0: **57 tools, 13 categories** (no change).

## [1.7.1] — 2026-05-20

### Removed
- `outlook_get_timezone`, `outlook_set_timezone`, `outlook_get_auto_reply`, `outlook_set_auto_reply` and the `mailbox_settings` permission category. Microsoft Graph's `/me/mailboxSettings` resource is documented as `Delegated (personal Microsoft account): Not supported`; every sub-path returns `ErrorAccessDenied` on outlook.com / hotmail.com / live.com mailboxes regardless of granted scopes. The project supports personal accounts only, so these four tools shipped in 1.7.0 are non-viable for every user. Verified directly against the live Graph API. The original brainstorm claim that `mailboxSettings` "works fully on outlook.com" was incorrect, and the v1.7.0 PR shipped without an integration smoke test that would have caught it.
- `MailboxSettings.Read` / `MailboxSettings.ReadWrite` Graph consent scopes (no longer requested).

### Fixed
- `outlook-mcp auth` device-code polling timeout raised from 300s to 900s to match Microsoft's 15-minute device-code TTL. The shorter default was failing real users whose sign-in flow takes more than 5 minutes (2FA, passkey prompts, browser delays).

### Unchanged from 1.7.0
- `outlook_list_inbox_overrides`, `outlook_set_inbox_override`, `outlook_delete_inbox_override` — Focused Inbox per-sender override CRUD via `/me/inferenceClassification/overrides`. Verified working on personal accounts.

### Migration from 1.7.0
- If you upgraded to 1.7.0 and re-authed: no action needed. The removed tools simply disappear; nothing else is affected.
- If you added `mailbox_settings` to `allow_categories` in `~/.outlook-mcp/config.json`: the server will refuse to load until you remove that string. The category no longer exists.

### Tool count
- 1.7.0: 61 tools, 14 categories.
- 1.7.1: **57 tools, 13 categories.**

## [1.7.0] — 2026-05-19

### Added — Mail Triage / Inference Overrides (3 tools)
- `outlook_list_inbox_overrides` — List Focused Inbox per-sender override rules.
- `outlook_set_inbox_override` — Upsert a per-sender override (`focused`/`other`). Case-insensitive sender matching; PATCH-if-exists, else POST. Gated by the existing `mail_triage` permission category.
- `outlook_delete_inbox_override` — Delete an override by ID.

These are the rule-level parallel of `outlook_reclassify_message`, which only fixes a single message in place.

### Added — Mailbox Settings (4 tools, new category)
- `outlook_get_timezone` / `outlook_set_timezone` — read/write `/me/mailboxSettings/timeZone`. Accepts IANA (`America/Los_Angeles`) or Windows (`Pacific Standard Time`) zone names; Graph validates.
- `outlook_get_auto_reply` / `outlook_set_auto_reply` — read/write the out-of-office / auto-reply configuration via `/me/mailboxSettings/automaticRepliesSetting`. Supports `disabled` / `always` / `scheduled` status, internal + external messages (with mirror-from-internal default), `none` / `contacts_only` / `all` external-audience scopes, and scheduled start/end datetimes.

All four are gated by a new `mailbox_settings` permission category.

### Auth scopes
- `MailboxSettings.Read` (read-only mode) and `MailboxSettings.ReadWrite` (full mode) added to the consent scope lists. **Existing users must re-run `outlook-mcp auth`** so the cached token picks up the new scopes — otherwise the four mailbox-settings tools will fail with an auth error.

### Notes
- `outlook_get_auto_reply` returns scheduled datetimes as UTC ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`) after translating common Windows zone names via a built-in CLDR mapping. When a zone can't be translated (rare, e.g. an obscure Windows display name not in the mapping), the value is emitted as `LOCAL:<datetime> <tz>` — explicitly non-UTC so callers don't silently treat local time as UTC.
- Tool count: **54 → 61**.

## [1.6.1] — 2026-05-17

Documentation-only release. Functionally identical to 1.6.0; no code changes. Cut to refresh the README that ships on the PyPI project page.

### Documentation
- Privacy & Security section corrected to describe the actual platform-by-platform token storage behavior after 1.6.0's libsecret-fallback fix (#8, #12). The previous unconditional "no tokens are written to disk in plaintext" claim is accurate on macOS Keychain, Windows DPAPI, and Linux with libsecret — but not on Linux without (e.g. `uv tool install` on Ubuntu, the failure mode reported in #7). The new text spells out each path and the one-time warning behavior.
- Tool Reference tables in README updated to document the parameters added in 1.6.0: `deferred_send_datetime` on create/update draft, `is_html` on update draft, and `include_deferred_send` on read message.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-05-17

### Added
- `outlook_create_draft` and `outlook_update_draft` accept a
  `deferred_send_datetime: str` parameter (ISO 8601). The value is set as
  the legacy MAPI `PR_DEFERRED_SEND_TIME` extended property (`SystemTime
  0x3FEF`); once the draft is sent (e.g. via `outlook_send_draft`),
  Exchange holds the message server-side until the given UTC instant.
  This is the same mechanism Outlook desktop uses for "Delay Delivery"
  and runs server-side, so the client doesn't need to be online at the
  scheduled time. On `update_draft`, passing an empty string clears the
  property. Inputs are validated and normalized to UTC ISO 8601 (`Z`
  form). ([#10])
- `outlook_update_draft` accepts `is_html: bool = False`. Required when
  overwriting a draft originally composed as HTML in the Outlook
  web/desktop UI — PATCHing such a draft with a Text body is rejected
  by the consumer-Outlook MAPI store with `ErrorAccessDenied` /
  `MapiSetProperties`. Default stays Text for back-compat. ([#10])
- `outlook_read_message` accepts `include_deferred_send: bool = False`.
  When `True`, surfaces the `PR_DEFERRED_SEND_TIME` extended property as
  `deferred_send_datetime` in the response (`null` if not set). Enables
  read-then-recreate workflows that preserve a draft's scheduled send
  time. ([#10])

### Fixed
- `outlook_download_attachment` was writing Microsoft Graph's
  base64-encoded `contentBytes` straight to disk, producing a base64
  text file instead of the actual binary. The tool now decodes the
  content before writing. Reported and fixed by @andylokandy. ([#9])

### Changed (breaking)
- `outlook_download_attachment` no longer accepts `save_path=None` and no
  longer returns `content_base64` in the response. `save_path` is now
  required and the tool always writes decoded bytes to that path,
  returning `{saved_to, name, size, content_type}`. The in-memory base64
  return path was the wrong paradigm for attachments — large binaries
  through the MCP message channel burn LLM context tokens — and the
  on-disk path was the buggy one (see Fixed). If you were relying on
  `content_base64`, switch to passing `save_path` and reading the file.
  ([#9])

### Changed
- The unencrypted token-cache fallback enabled in #8 now emits a
  one-time `logger.warning(...)` on the first credential build when
  PyGObject/libsecret isn't importable. macOS Keychain and Windows
  DPAPI still cache encrypted as before; only Linux installs without
  PyGObject (e.g. `uv tool install` on Ubuntu — issue #7) take the
  plaintext path, and now surface that fact to operators instead of
  silently writing tokens to disk.

[#10]: https://github.com/mpalermiti/outlook-mcp/pull/10

## [1.5.2] — 2026-04-29

### Documentation / positioning
- Sharpened SKILL.md `description:` (drives the ClawHub search snippet) to lead with positioning ("MCP server, not a CLI wrapper") instead of a generic feature list. Highlights granular permissions, OS-keyring auth, batch optimization, and BYO Azure app — the differentiators against other Outlook skills in the registry.
- Added a "Who this is for / How it differs from other Outlook tools" section near the top of README.md so users browsing the listing can self-select in 30 seconds.

No code changes from 1.5.1.

## [1.5.1] — 2026-04-29

### Documentation
- Corrected stale `## Tools (51)` heading in `SKILL.md` to `## Tools (54)`. The frontmatter description was already correct, but the body heading rendered on the ClawHub skill page was missed when PRs #3 and #4 added new tools. Functionally identical to 1.5.0; no code changes.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- `outlook_send_message`, `outlook_send_with_attachments`, `outlook_create_draft`, and `outlook_update_draft` accept a `reply_to: list[str]` parameter that maps 1:1 to Microsoft Graph's `message.replyTo`. On `update_draft`, `reply_to=[]` clears the field. ([#3])
- `outlook_attach_to_draft(draft_id, attachment_paths)` adds files to an existing draft, reusing the 3 MB inline / upload-session split from `outlook_send_with_attachments`. Returns the new attachment IDs for inline (small-file) attachments. ([#4])
- `outlook_remove_draft_attachment(draft_id, attachment_id)` deletes a single attachment from a draft. ([#4])
- Tool count: 52 → 54.

### Fixed
- **Tasks (`outlook_create_task` / `outlook_update_task` / `outlook_complete_task`):** request payloads were being built as raw `dict`s, but the Microsoft Graph SDK calls `.serialize()` on the payload — so every call failed with `'dict' object has no attribute 'serialize'`. All three tools now build typed `TodoTask` SDK models with `DateTimeTimeZone`, `ItemBody`, `Importance` enum, and `TaskStatus` enum. The `recurrence` dict input is converted to a typed `PatternedRecurrence` (with `RecurrencePattern` / `RecurrenceRange` and strict enum validation across `RecurrencePatternType`, `DayOfWeek`, `WeekIndex`, `RecurrenceRangeType`). Reported by @waynegault. ([#2], [#5])
- **Contacts (`outlook_list_contacts` / `outlook_search_contacts` / `outlook_get_contact` / `outlook_create_contact` / `outlook_update_contact`):** the consumer Outlook (Outlook.com / Hotmail) Graph endpoint does not expose the unified `phones` aggregate property — only `mobilePhone` (single string), `homePhones` (list), and `businessPhones` (list). Reads requested `phones` via `$select` and got 400; writes set `Contact.phones = [Phone()]` and would have hit the same 400 on consumer accounts. The whole module is migrated to the consumer Graph schema. Reported by @waynegault. ([#1], [#6])

### Changed (potentially breaking response shape)
- `outlook_get_contact` no longer returns `phones: [{number, type}]`. It now returns three separate fields: `mobile_phone: str`, `home_phones: list[str]`, `business_phones: list[str]`. The old field was always empty on consumer accounts, so any consumer parsing it was already getting `[]` — but if you have code reading `phones[0].number`, switch to `mobile_phone`.
- `outlook_list_contacts` and `outlook_search_contacts` summary responses keep their top-level `phone: str` field, but it is now correctly populated via mobile → first home → first business fallback (was previously empty on consumer accounts).
- Tool *inputs* are unchanged: `outlook_create_contact(phone=...)` and `outlook_update_contact(phone=...)` still take a single phone string, now stored as `mobilePhone`.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- Both `outlook_list_folders(recursive=True)` and the folder name resolver were stopping at Microsoft Graph's default page size (10) when walking subfolders, silently dropping any user folder sorted after the 10th child. Fix paginates via `@odata.nextLink` and requests `$top=100` up front.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-21

### Added
- Recursive folder listing and subfolder name resolution.
